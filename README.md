**Using Python to Interact with the Operating System**

- About this Course

  By the end of this course, you’ll be able to manipulate files and processes on your computer’s operating system. You’ll also have learned about regular expressions -- a     very powerful tool for processing text files -- and you’ll get practice using the Linux command line on a virtual machine. And, this might feel like a stretch right        now, but you’ll also write a program that processes a bunch of errors in an actual log file and then generates a summary file. That’s a super useful skill for IT           Specialists to know.

  We’ll kick off by exploring how to execute Python locally, and organize and use code across different Python files. We'll then learn how to read and write different types of files, and use subprocesses and input streams. We'll also dive into Bash scripting and regular expressions -- both very powerful tools for anyone working with systems. We'll even touch on automatic testing, which allows us to automate how we check if our code is correct. To finish, we’ll put all this together by using the tools that we’ve acquired to process data and generate automatic reports. We’ll also explain how to set up your own developer environment in your machine. This is a key step in being able to write and deploy powerful automation tools.

Module 1

    Getting Your Python On
    
    In this module, you’ll learn about the different types of operating systems, and how you can get your python code ready to interact with the operating system. We’ll learn about getting your environment set up and installing additional Python modules that will help you along the way. We’ll rundown interpreted versus compiled language, and how they differ from each other. We’ll dive into the benefits of automation, and point out common pitfalls so you can avoid them. Finally, we’ll learn about Qwiklabs, which will be used for graded assessments.

- How It Works

  General
  
1. How do I pass?

    To earn your Certificate, you’ll need to earn a passing
      grade on each of the required assignments—these can be quizzes,
      peer-graded assignments, or programming assignments. Videos, readings,
      and practice exercises are there to help you prepare for the graded
      assignments. 

2. What do start dates and end dates mean?

    Once you enroll,
      you’ll have access to all videos, readings, quizzes, and programming
      assignments (if applicable). If you choose to
      explore the content without purchasing, you may not be able to access
      certain assignments.  If you don’t finish all graded assignments before
      the end of the session, you can reset your deadlines. Your
      progress will be saved and you’ll be able to pick up where you left off.
    
3. What are due dates? Is there a penalty for submitting my
      work after a due date?

      Within a course, there are suggested due dates to help you
        manage your schedule and keep work from piling up. Quizzes and
        programming assignments can be submitted late without consequence.
        However, it is possible that you won't receive a grade if you submit
        your peer-graded assignment too late because classmates usually review
        assignment within three days of the assignment deadline.

4. Can I re-attempt an assignment?

      Yes. If you want to improve your grade, you can always try again.
        If you’re re-attempting a peer-graded assignment, re-submit your work
        as soon as you can to make sure there’s enough time for your classmates
        to review your work. In some cases you may need to wait before
        re-submitting a programming assignment or quiz. We encourage you to
        review learning material during this delay.
